firehol (1.256-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release reverts the split from firehol into firehol-wizard,firehol and
  the lib. That will make updates much easier in the future.
  get-iana (a script for updating the list of reserved ips) is now available
  you can run it regulary to update your ip list. Its recommended to install
  the aggregate package to aggregate the ip ranges from the iana.
