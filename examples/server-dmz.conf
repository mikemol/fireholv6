#
# CASE:
# Configuration file for a dual path server.
#
# The first network interface is connected to the internet to accept
# requests for services running on this server.
#
# The second network interface is connected to a private LAN, through
# which a number of similar servers communicate with each other.
#
# The server will only be allowed to accept and send specific traffic
# matching the servers and clients defined.

# You can use more than one (space separated) and if your server
# has many aliases for the same interface, you can use the plus sign
# to match them all (e.g. eth0+).

# Enter here all the IPs your server accepts requests from the internet.
# This variable accepts a space separated list of IPs, hostnames, etc.
# You can leave this empty if you don't want to restrict the IPs traffic
